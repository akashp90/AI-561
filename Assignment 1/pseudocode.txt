while enqueud is not empty:
	get location by popping from enq
	
	if the current location is the destination, exit

	calculate momentum at this step, which is kinda like elevation change from the previous location
	from this momentum, get the list of movable locations
	mark this position as visited with the momentum calculated previously

	for each of the movable location, calculate the cost(along with the heuristic) to visit each location with this momentum
	insert each movable location into enqueued list sorted by cost if the location has not been previously visited with this momentum
